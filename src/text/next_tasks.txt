- With 400MB file (whole_string.txt) we have a memory error. Why?
  It should be large enough to fit into RAM. Actually I'm not sure
  because num levels ~= 30 in this case and 400 * 30 MB = 12GB which
  does not fit into RAM. Investigate this.

-> When setting num_levels = 1 do we have a crash. Answer: Yes.

- Implement proof of concept with external memory sorting.
