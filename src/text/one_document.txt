Boris Johnson has called on the British public to discard the labels of leave and remain as MPs prepared to take a historic step towards withdrawing the UK from the EU. The prime minister was opening the debate on the second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill (Wab), MPs’ first opportunity to vote on Brexit since last week’s general election. “We come together as a new parliament to break the deadlock and finally to get Brexit done,” Johnson said. He said the electorate’s decision to press ahead with leaving the EU “must not be seen as a victory for one party over another, or one faction or another. This is the time when we move on and discard the old labels of leave and remain.”In a characteristic literary aside, Johnson claimed the terms were “as defunct as Big-Enders and Little-Enders, and Montagues and Capulets at the end of the play” – terms from Gulliver’s Travels and Romeo and Juliet respectively. Responding to Johnson, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, confirmed his party would continue to oppose the bill – though some Labour MPs, including shadow cabinet members, have argued that the election result means they should support it and move on.
